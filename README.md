# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION

3.Implementation of Delta Modulation 
  
## AIM    
 To study the Delta Modulation and obtain delta modulated waveform using the trainer kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE
1. Connections are to be given as per the block diagram.
2. Observe the modulated waveforms.
3. Measure the amplitude and time period of both the waveforms.
4. Plot the graph.
